**Q1. What are the three assumptions of kinetic theory of matter?**  
**A:**  
1. Matter is made up of tiny particles called molecules.  
2. These particles are in constant motion.  
3. There are spaces between the particles, and they attract each other.

**Q2. What are the factors affecting the states of matter? Explain.**  
**A:**  
The two main factors are **temperature** and **pressure**.  
- Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles, which can change the state.  
- Increasing pressure compresses matter, which can also cause a change in state.

**Q3. On the basis of kinetic theory of matter, explain:**  
- **Why solids have a definite volume and definite shape**  
- **Why liquids have a definite volume and no definite shape**  
- **Why gases have no definite volume and no definite shape**  

**A:**  
- **Solids:** Particles are tightly packed with strong forces between them, so they have a fixed shape and volume.  
- **Liquids:** Particles are close together but can move around, so they have fixed volume but take the shape of the container.  
- **Gases:** Particles are far apart and move freely, so they have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.

**Q4. Write the physical state of matter that shows the property given:**  
**A:**  
- **Rigid and incompressible:** Solid  
- **Most compressible form of matter:** Gas  
- **Have definite volume but no fixed shape:** Liquid  
- **Has largest inter-particle space but weakest form of attraction:** Gas

**Q5. Explain the following on the basis of the kinetic theory of matter:**  
- **Sublimation**  
- **Melting**  
- **Boiling**

**A:**  
- **Sublimation:** Some solids gain enough energy for their particles to escape directly into the gas phase.  
- **Melting:** Solid particles absorb heat, vibrate faster, and become loosely held, turning into liquid.  
- **Boiling:** Liquid particles gain enough energy to overcome attraction and change into gas.

**Q6. Tabulate the differences in the characteristics of states of matter:**  

| State   | Shape      | Volume        | Compressibility        |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Solid   | Fixed      | Fixed         | Not compressible        |
| Liquid  | Not fixed  | Fixed         | Slightly compressible   |
| Gas     | Not fixed  | Not fixed     | Highly compressible     |

**Q7. Discuss briefly the effects of temperature on the change of state of a solid into a liquid and that of a liquid into a gas.**  
**A:**  
- **Solid to liquid (melting):** Heat increases particle movement, breaking strong bonds, and turning the solid into a liquid.  
- **Liquid to gas (boiling/evaporation):** Further heating makes particles move faster and break free into the gas phase.

**Q8. List the basic changes of states of matter:**  
**A:**  
1. Melting  
2. Freezing  
3. Vaporization  
4. Condensation  
5. Sublimation  
6. Deposition

**Q9. Show in a flowchart the complete cycle of change in state:**  
**A:**  
```

       |             v
        <---------->  
         (Sublimation and Deposition)
```

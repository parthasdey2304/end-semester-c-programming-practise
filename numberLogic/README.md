## Physical and Chemical Changes

**1. Which bonds are broken and which bonds are formed during a chemical reaction?**
During a chemical reaction, the **bonds between atoms in the reactants are broken**, and **new bonds are formed between atoms to make the products**.

---

**2. Name the most commonly used solvents.**
The most commonly used solvents are:

* **Water**
* **Alcohol**
* **Acetone**
* **Petrol**

---

**3. What are photochemical reactions?**
Photochemical reactions are **chemical reactions that take place in the presence of light**, especially sunlight.
*Example: Photosynthesis in plants.*

---

**4. Which water allows electricity to pass through it?**
**Impure water** (like tap water or salty water) allows electricity to pass through it because it contains **dissolved salts or minerals** that conduct electricity.

---

**5. Name the catalyst used to decompose potassium chlorate.**
The catalyst used to decompose potassium chlorate is **manganese dioxide (MnO₂)**.

---

**6. Reaction is fastest in gaseous state. Explain.**
In the gaseous state, **particles move very fast and collide more frequently**, which increases the **rate of reaction**, making it faster than in liquids or solids.

---

**7. Give complete equation for the formation of ammonia.**
**N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃**
(This is the balanced equation for the formation of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.)

---

**8. Define chemical reaction.**
A chemical reaction is a **process in which one or more substances (reactants) change into new substances (products)** with different properties.

---

**9. Give four reasons to prove that burning of paper is an example of chemical reaction.**

* New substances like **ash, carbon dioxide, and smoke** are formed.
* **Heat and light** are released.
* The change is **permanent and irreversible**.
* There is a **change in color and smell**.

---

**10. Give a balanced reaction for photosynthesis in plants.**
**6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂**
(in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll)

---

**11. Differentiate between physical and chemical changes.**

| Physical Change                  | Chemical Change            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| No new substance is formed       | New substance is formed    |
| Usually reversible               | Usually irreversible       |
| No change in chemical properties | Chemical properties change |
| Example: melting of ice          | Example: burning of wood   |

---

**12. Explain the concept of catalyst and promoter.**

* A **catalyst** is a substance that **speeds up a chemical reaction without being used up** in the reaction.
* A **promoter** is a substance that **increases the efficiency of a catalyst**, but does not work alone.
